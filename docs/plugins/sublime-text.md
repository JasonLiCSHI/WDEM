> **Development status:** WDEM currently provides transition libraries and automated tests only. No public CLI or desktop host exists yet, so command and distribution examples on this page are design references rather than supported product instructions. Binary releases will be enabled only after `Wdem.Cli` and `Wdem.Desktop` exist.

# Sublime Text Plugin

## Overview

The Sublime Text plugin manages user preferences in Sublime Text by updating the `Preferences.sublime-settings` file.

Settings defined in WDEM are merged into the existing Sublime Text configuration, preserving unrelated settings while updating managed values.

## Prerequisites

- Sublime Text installed
- `subl.exe` or `sublime_text.exe` available in PATH

## Configuration Schema

| Key | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| settings | JSON settings written into `Preferences.sublime-settings` |

Any valid Sublime Text user preference can be placed inside the `settings` block.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Preferences

```yaml
extensions:
  sublime-text:
    settings:
      font_size: 14
      word_wrap: true
      tab_size: 4
```

### Theme And Appearance

```yaml
extensions:
  sublime-text:
    settings:
      theme: "Adaptive.sublime-theme"
      color_scheme: "Packages/Color Scheme - Default/Mariana.sublime-color-scheme"
      highlight_line: true
```

### Editor Behavior

```yaml
extensions:
  sublime-text:
    settings:
      auto_complete: true
      save_on_focus_lost: true
      trim_trailing_white_space_on_save: true
```

## Verification Steps

Open Sublime Text and verify that the configured settings are applied.

You can also inspect:

```text
%APPDATA%\Sublime Text\Packages\User\Preferences.sublime-settings
```

and confirm the configured values are present.

## Notes / Caveats

- Existing settings are preserved unless the same key is managed by WDEM.
- New settings are merged into the current configuration.
- Invalid JSON in the existing settings file may prevent settings from being read correctly.
